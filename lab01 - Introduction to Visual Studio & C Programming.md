# Getting Started

We will be performing our file editing, compilation and execution through **Visual Studio 2022**. Visual Studio 2022 should already be installed on computers within the timetabled lab classroom. This is not the only choice for C compilation but the environment is very powerful and will be extremely useful for GPU computing later in the course. You may wish, in your own time, to try out the examples in unix using the GCC toolchain (or GCC via MinGW for Windows).

**Please note that Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is distinct from Visual Studio Community edition that we will be using.**

# Hello World

For our first application we will create a basic hello world application. Create a new empty project (by following the guide in `Visual Studio 2022 Overview.pdf`). Create a new solution with the project and call it `Lab01`. 

**Save your project to a path within** `U:\com4521`, using the `\\studata` path **WILL** cause complications later on in the module when using the CUDA compiler. Likewise, some files within `U:\com4521` have been whitelisted for the AV, so it’s worth getting into the habit of placing your work in this folder now.

Create a new file in the project by right clicking on the project you have just created and select `Add->New Item`. From the options select Visual C++ and choose C++ File (`.cpp`). When naming your new file ensure that you give it the `.c` (and not `.cpp`) file extension.

```c
/* Hello World program */
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    // output some text
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Build your program by selecting `Build->Build Solution` or shortcut key `F7`.

Execute your program by selecting `Debug->Start Debugging` or shortcut key `F5`.

If your program exits before you can view the output, then either;

1.  Execute without debugging (`Ctrl+F5`) which will issue a system pause; or
2.  Place a breakpoint on the main return statement to cause the IDE to break before exiting.


# Exercise 1

Add a new empty project to the solution called `Lab01_Exercise01` by right clicking on the solution and selecting `Add->New Project...` To select it as the project which we would like to execute right click on the project and select `Set as Startup Project`. Add a new source file called `exercise1.c` and copy the contents from our hello world example. You can remove the hello world print command. Make a copy of the provided `random.h` file and place it in your project's source directory\footnote{If you right-click your project in the solution explorer, near the bottom of the context menu you will find "Open Folder in File Explorer" which opens this directory.}. Add the `random.h` header file to the project by right clicking on the project in the solution explorer and selecting `Add->Existing item`, or dragging it from the file explorer into the project. **If `random.h` has not been copied into the project's source directory, the compiler will not be able to find it on the include path.**

We are going to create a program to create a list of normalised random integers.

1.  Create a pre-processor definition called `NUM_VALUES` and assign it the value of `250`.
2.  Declare a global signed 32-bit integer **array** called `value` using your pre-processor definition to define the array size.
3.  Define a local unsigned 32-bit integer variable called `sum` in the main function capable of holding only positive values and initialise it to 0. 
4.  Define a local variable `i` in the main function using a data type which can hold values in the range of 0-255, initialise it to 0.
   
    *Note: If you **declare** your variables and set their values (i.e. **define** them) on separate lines then you will need to ensure that both your declaration and definition appear before any expressions (e.g. `sum=0;`).*
5. We need to make a call to a function declared in a header file `random.h`, include the header file and call `init_random` in the main function.
6.  Write a simple for loop (using the integer `i` as a counter) in the range of 0 and `NUM_VALUES`. Within the loop make a call to the function `random_ushort` and save the value in the values array at index `i`. Within the loop create a print statement to the console which outputs in a single line the value of `i` and the value you have stored in the array. We can use this to debug the output.
7.  The `random_ushort` function contains an implicit cast from `int` to `unsigned short`. Modify this so that it uses an explicit cast. This won’t change the program but is good practice.
8.  Modify your loop by commenting out the print statement and summing the value into the variable `sum`. Output the sum value after the loop has returned. What is the sum? It should be `4125024`. Add a new local variable `average` using an appropriate data type. Calculate and store the average value of the random numbers.
9.  Normalise the random numbers by subtracting the average. Calculate the minimum and maximum values. A ternary `if` operator

   ```
   (conditional expression)? expression_t : expression_f ;
   ```

   can be used to return either `expression_t` if the conditional is `true` or `expression_f` is the condition is `false`.
   
   E.g. `int x = (a == 0) ? 123 : 567;`
   
   Use this shorthand notion in calculating the min and max values. Print the average, min and max values along with the sum.


You should get the following values:

```
Sum=4125024
Average=16500
Min=-16247
Max=16221
```

# Exercise 2

We are now going to extend the previous exercise by implementing a better random function. 

Add a new empty project to the solution called `Lab01_Exercise02`. Make sure that the folder location is the root of your solution (and not one of the previous projects). Set the new project as the start-up project, so when you run the program it won’t run the previous project. Make a copy of the source and header file from the previous exercise (rename `exercise1.c` to `exercise2.c`) and move them the new projects source folder. Add them to the project by selecting `Add->Existing Items`.

The problem with the existing rand function is that it only returns values in the range of `0-32767` (the positive range of a signed short) despite returning a 32 bit integer. This is due Microsoft preserving backwards compatibility with code utilising the function when it was first implemented (and when 16 bit integers were more common). This is a “feature” of the msvc runtime. You will find in Linux that rand returns a full 32 bit number.


1.  Let us start by separating the random function definitions into a header and separate source module. Create a new file in the project called `random.c`. Move the `init_random()` and `random_ushort()` function definitions into the new source module. Move the inclusion of `stdlib.h` to the new source module and include `random.h` in `random.c`. The `random.h` file should now only contain the seed. Build the application. The compiler should give a warning that the two functions are undefined.
2.  Modify `random.h` by adding appropriate function declarations. If you don’t include the `extern` keyword then it will be implicitly defined by the compiler (as all globals are `extern` by default). It is good practice to include it. The project should now build without errors.
3.  We are now going to implement simple [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator). This works by advancing a seed by a simple multiplication and addition. Define the parameters `RANDOM_A` and `RANDOM_C` in `random.h` using a pre-processor macro. Set their values to `1103515245` and `12345` respectively.
4.  Create a 32 bit unsigned global integer variable called `rseed` in `random.c`. Modify `init_random()` to set the value of `rseed` to `RAND_SEED`.
5.  Create a function declaration (in `random.h`) and definition (in `random.c`) for a function `random_uint()` returning an `unsigned int`. Implement a linear generator using the equation:

    \begin{math}x_{(n+1)} = A x_{(n)} + C\end{math}
    
    where x can use the variable `rseed` (with an initial value \begin{math}x_0\end{math} = `RAND_SEED` as per exercise 2.4), and A and C are your parameters.
6.  Replace the call to `random_ushort` with a call to `random_uint` in `exercise2.c`. Our variable sum is now too small to hold the summed values. Modify it to a 64 bit unsigned integer and ensure it is printed to the console correctly. Modify the type of the values array to a 64 bit signed integer also. You will also need to modify min and max to use 64 bit signed integers, as the normalised values may still be outside of the range of the current 32 bit integers. Ensure that your `printf()` formats are correct for the data types. 

What is the sum, average, min and max?

They should be:

```
Sum=524529029501
Average=2098116118
Min=-2093214053
Max= 2170533120
```

# Exercise 3

We are now going to extend the previous exercise by implementing a floating point random function. 

Add a new empty project to the solution called `Lab01_Exercise03`. Make sure that the folder location is the root of your solution (and not one of the previous projects). Set the new project as the start-up project. Make a copy of the source and header file from the previous exercise (rename `exercise3.c` to `exercise4.c`) and move them the new projects source folder. Add them to the project by selecting `Add->Existing Items`.

1.  Add a new function definition and declaration (`random_float()`) returning a random `float`. This should be a value cast from the `random_uint()` function. Modify the example so that floating point values are calculated for sum, average, min and max. Ensure that the values are printed with 0 decimal places.

What is the sum, average, min and max?

They should be:

```
Sum=524529139712
Average=2098116608
Min=-2093214592
Max=2170532608
```

# Exercise 4

You are going to create a calculator which takes input from the command line.

Add a new empty project to the solution called `Lab01_Exercise04` by right clicking on the solution and selecting `Add->New Project...` To select it as the project which we would like to execute right click on the project and select `Set as Startup Project`. Make a copy of the file `exercise4.c` (which is provided for you) and place it in your projects source directory. Add the file to the project by selecting `Add->Existing Items`.

The source file contains the basic structure of a simple command line calculator which will understand the following basic commands `"add N"`, `"sub N"`, `"mul N"`, `"div N"` and `"exit"`, where `N` is a floating point value.

1.  Complete the while loop by adding character sequentially to the buffer.
2.  Implement a check to ensure that you don’t write past the end of the buffers limits. Writing passed the end of an array is called an overflow. When an potential overflow is detected write an error message to `stderr` using `fprintf()` and then call `exit(1)` to force the program to terminate early.
3.  Ensure that once the while loop has exited the buffer is correctly terminated with the string termination character.
4.  Use the `strcmp()` function to test if the line reads `"exit"`. If it does, then readLine should return `0` otherwise it should return 1. Test the program. It should quit when a user enters `"exit"` otherwise it should print `"Unknown command"`.
5.  Modify the while loop in the main function. Check that the line contains a three characters followed by a space. You can use the `isalpha()` function from `ctype.h` to check that a character is a letter. If the line does not meet this criteria, then output an error `"Incorrect command format"` to `stderr` and use continue to begin the loop again.
6.  Assuming the criteria for 4.5 is met then use `sscanf()` to extract the 3 character command and the floating point value from the buffer to command and a respectively.
    *Note: You will need to pass `in_value` to `sscanf()` prefixed with the `&` operator.*
    *E.g `sscanf(…, &in_value)`. This will be explained in the next lecture.*
7.  Modify the condition false to check the command to see if it is equal to `"add"`.
8.  Create an `else if` condition for `"sub"`, `"mul"`, `"div"`. Test your program.
9.  Add additional conditions using `strncmp()` to test the first two letter of the command. If it is `"ad"` then output `"Did you mean add?"` Complete cases for `"su"`, `"mu"`, `"di"`. Test your program.

# Exercise 5

We are now going to extend the previous exercise by modifying the calculator so that it can read commands from a file.

Add a new empty project to the solution called `Lab01_Exercise05`. Make sure that the folder location is the root of your solution (and not one of the previous projects). Set the new project as the start-up project. Make a copy of the source file from the previous exercise in the new projects source folder. Rename the source file from `exercise4.c` to `exercise5.c`. Add the source file to the project by selecting `Add->Existing Items`.

Modify the example so that it can read the provided `commands.calc` file. You will need to implement the following:

1.  Open and closing the file in read only mode
2.  Modify the `readLine()` function so that it reads form a file rather than the console. You should check for end of file character (`EOF`) and return `0` if it is found. 
    *Note: this behaviour requires any `.calc` files to have a blank line at the end of the file.*
3.  Modify the main function. Incorrect commands or misspelt commands should cause a console error and immediate exit. The while loop should be silent (no console output) and only the final sum should be output to the console. The correct answer is `99.0000`.
